### Using Apache POI to read from MS Excel File

This repository conatins Java code which demonstrates how to read Excel files
in Java code.
I have used the Apache POI library for reading the Excel file.

It is assumed that the excel file contains simple data in two columns.
The first column contains name of a student, the second contains his favorite subject.

Both OOXML MS office formats (which include MS Excel 2007,2010,2013) and XML MS Office formats (MS Excel 2003 and prior) are supported for reading.

Maven is used for dependency managment.
